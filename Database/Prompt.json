Prompt for Streamlined Table-Processing:
System_instruction: This task is to take the simplified table webpage as input and convert each cell in the table body to customised format and output it as the json document. Please directly give the answer without any analysis.
Task: The customised format is <Table Title><Row Header><Column Header>=<Entry Value>, and if the table has multilayered header, extract corresponding header from outside to inside. 2 examples are given, just help you to understand the customised format. Webpage that are slightly different in symbols need you to process. Note:
1.colspan and rowspan mean the cell occupies multiple columns or rows,
2.morerows=x or morecols=x mean occupies (x+1) columns or rows,
3.<entry>, <entry:&nbsp>, or no element exists after “:” mean a blank space should be leaved in the cell.

Task: We already list most of common properties of alloy.

Example: Input: The average grain diameters of the GH0, GH1-composite specimens were 6.9 and 6.6 μm, respectively. Fig. 12 shows the tensile test results of GH0 and GH1-composite specimens at ambient temperature (25 °C) and elevated temperature (900 °C). At ambient temperature, a relatively low yield strength (YS: 587 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (UTS: 690 MPa) and elongation (El: 6.6%) of GH0 may be attributed to cracking defects in the specimens. In contrast, the GH1-composite specimens showed a significant improvement in YS and UTS values, up to 882 and 1214 MPa, respectively. The El value of GH1-composite (14.2%) was also over twice that of GH0 (6.6%). Compared with GH0, the tensile properties of GH1-composite at ambient temperature were significantly improved, mainly because of the elimination of cracks and the addition of 1 wt% TiB2 particles. At elevated-temperature conditions, the YS and UTS of GH0 and GH1- composite specimens both decreased significantly. The YS values of GH0 and GH1-composite were 173 and 288 MPa, respectively, and their UTS values were 213 and 352 MPa, respectively. The El values of GH1-composite at elevated temperature was 36.8%, which was significantly higher compared to the ambient-temperature condition, which was mainly due to the large number of cracks in the GH1 specimens.
