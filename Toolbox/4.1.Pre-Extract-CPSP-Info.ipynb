They were mechanically mirror-polished with alumina powder of 0.3\\xa0µm and ultrasonically rinsed in acetone and ethanol. They were heated at 400–800\\xa0°C for 3.6 ks in the air for oxidation. The surface morphology of the samples was observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JXA-6300P, JEOL, Japan). The surface film formed by the heat treatment was examined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a diffractometer (X’pert pro, PANalytical, Japan) operating at 45\\xa0kV and 40\\xa0mA. The average (arithmetical mean) surface roughness, Ra, and length measured along the surface roughness contour, L', were analyzed using a surface roughness tester (SE-3F, Kosaka Laboratory Ltd.). The surface area ratio, r , was evaluated using the following equation: L is the length being measured along a perfectly smooth sample surface. The water contact angle (WCA) of the sample, representing wettability, was also evaluated.\", \"The samples were sterilized at 121\\xa0°C for 1.2 ks for the cell culture experiments.

The initial density of cells in each culture plate well was 2000 cells/well. After culturing, these samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with a combination of two fluorescent dyes. One dye was phalloidin, which stains the actin of a cell, and the other dye was DAPI, which stains the cell nucleus. The morphology and number of cells were evaluated using a fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus). The number of cells on the surface of the sample in a 1-mm2 square area was counted by using the image analysis software, the Image J . The cell number was counted in three areas in each sample; then, the average value was obtained. The “cell proliferation” value was defined as the number of cells after 24\\xa0h culture divided by that after 6\\xa0h culture. The area of a cell (cell area, C.A.) was also measured for cell size evaluation after a 6\\xa0h culture. Cell shape was quantified via the shape index (S.I.\\u2009=\\u20094πA/p2)  using the Image J software. The A is the cell area, and the p is the perimeter of the cell. The shape index for the spherical cells will be one, while that for elongated morphology will be less than one. Statistical significance was evaluated at a p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 level.

The preparation of the tensile specimens was essentially the same as in the previous investigation . Cylindrical polycrystals with two different grain sizes d were produced by thermo-mechanical treatments. d was defined as the average spacing of GBs along straight lines; twin boundaries were not counted as GBs . All relevant data have been compiled in Table 1 . d was 6.1 and 265 μm. All specimens were given a 2-hour long γ′-nucleation treatment at 973 K and aged for t 1 = 51.5 h at T 1 = 1079 K. The resulting γ′-precipitate dispersion was: f 1 = (0.061 ± 0.009), r 1 = (25.0 ± 1.5) nm. The latter two data were calculated from the published functions f(T) and r(T, t) . The square lattice spacing L min1 defined in Section 1 in connection with relation (4) equals 155 nm. The two values quoted in the following for the PFZ-widths w′ have been taken from the literature ; they are averages over about six GBs. The widths of individual PFZs in a specimen vary considerably. w1′=103nm of the finely grained (d = 6.1 μm) polycrystals was below the limit given by relation (4) for softening by PFZs: w1′ equaled only 0.8 · (L min1 − r 1). w1′=650nm of the coarsely grained (d = 265 μm) specimens well exceeded the limit: w1′=5.0·(Lmin1-r1) . Hence these two types of polycrystals are designated NO-PFZi (d = 6.1 μm) and PFZi (d = 265 μm). i indicates the number of aging treatments given to the respective specimens. i equals 1 for those aged only at 1079 K and i equals 2 for those which were double aged. The second aging treatment was 42.5 h at 949 K. It raised f 1 and r 1 to f1′≈0.07andr1′≈26nm, respectively, and produced a second fine γ′-precipitate dispersion characterized by f 2 ≈ 0.04 and r 2 ≈ 4 nm. This will be detailed in Section 3.1.', 'The temperatures and durations of the two aging treatments were chosen such that the NO-PFZ1-specimens were in the peak-aged state, but close to the over-aged one (, Section 2.2) and such that the second γ′-precipitate dispersion was fine. There were many fine γ′-precipitates in between the large ones grown at 1079 K and in the PFZs produced at 1079 K (Fig. 1 ). Hypothetical monomodal specimens which contained only the fine (f 2, r 2) γ′-precipitates throughout would be in the under-aged state.', {'content': ['The nominal gauge dimensions of the specimens were 6 mm length and 2 mm diameter. Four identically prepared specimens of each type were tensile tested at 295 K at the elongation rate 1.7 μm s−1 . Only every other specimen was strained to fracture; the deformation of the others was stopped at about 0.02 plastic strain. After unloading the dislocation structures of the latter specimens were studied by TEM (Section 2.2). The yield strength σ y, the ultimate tensile strength σ u, and the plastic strain ε f at fracture were evaluated. σ y is the normal stress which produces 0.002 plastic strain and σ u is the maximum load carried by the specimen divided by its cross-sectional area before the deformation. Analogously ε f is the plastic elongation divided by the original gauge length. These simple technical definitions of σ u and ε f were adopted because the plastically active volume of the specimens is difficult to determine if they form constrictions. The average experimental results for σ y, σ u, and ε f have been compiled in Table 1. The standard deviations are 0.7%, 2.2%, and 7.4%, respectively. Evidently the error limits of ε f are rather large; this is at least partially due to the fact that only two specimens were tensile tested to fracture. The agreement of the present results with those published by Krol et al. is within ±3.3% for σ y(NO-PFZ1), σ y(PFZ1), σ u(NO-PFZ1), and ε f(NO-PFZ1), within ±7.6% for σ u(PFZ1), and within ±21% for ε f(PFZ1).'], 'name': 'Tensile tests', 'type': 'ce_section'}, {'content': ['Two types of TEM investigations were carried out for bimodal specimens: (a) characterization of the two dispersions of coherent spherical nano-scale γ′-precipitates on the basis of dark field images and (b) studies of the dislocation configurations in the PFZs of plastically deformed PFZ2-specimens. Slices of 0.3 mm thickness were spark-cut normal to the axes of the specimens, electro-polished, and studied in a TEM operated at 200 kV. The techniques were analogous to those applied formerly . The thin foils should meet the following requirements, some of which are mutually exclusive .', 'The thickness z of the foils must exceed about three times the average γ′-precipitate radius r because in thinner foils the fraction of those γ′-precipitates which intersect the surfaces of the foils is so high that the respective corrections are inaccurate.', 'The probability of overlap of images of γ′-precipitates increases approximately in proportion to (f · z/r) where f is the γ′-volume fraction. Hence the foils must be rather thin. Also, because of the low intensity of the superlattice reflections, by which the γ′-precipitates are dark-field imaged, the foils must be thin.', 'The GBs must be approximately normal to the foil, because otherwise high tilting angles are necessary to image the PFZs at their correct width w′.', 'High angles of tilt in the TEM must be avoided because they complicate the evaluations of w′, f, and r.', 'Since there is multiple slip next to GBs (Section 1) , it must be possible to image several slip systems at rather low angles of tilt.Requirements (i), (ii) and (iv) apply to the characterization of γ′-precipitate dispersions, (iii) and (iv) to that of the PFZs, and (iii)–(v) to the studies of the dislocation configurations in the PFZs. In order to meet requirement (v) for the slip systems with the highest Schmid factors the foils were cut normal to the axes of the specimen. In the coarsely grained specimens only very few GBs lie in those parts of the foils which are transparent to 200 keV-electrons. Requirements (iii) and (iv) are fulfilled for the micrographs discussed in the following.', 'Fig. 1(a) shows the bimodal γ′-precipitate dispersion in the interior of a grain of a double aged specimen. The second aging treatment raised r 1 = 25 nm to r1′≈26nm (Section 3.1.2). In Fig. 1(b) a micrograph is presented, which was computer generated as described in Section 3.3. The two nominal γ′-precipitate dispersions and the nominal thickness of the foil are the same in Figs. 1(a) and (b). Evidently there are many more small γ′-precipitates in the simulated TEM image (Fig. 1(b)) than in the actual micrograph (Fig. 1(a)). One reason for this difference is that requirement (ii) is not fulfilled, not even approximately. Fig. 1(c) proves that in NO-PFZ2-specimens there are small (r 2 ≈ 4 nm) as well as large (r1′≈26nm) γ′-precipitates right up to the GBs and to a twin boundary; there are no carbide particles on either type of boundary. Fig. 1(d) gives the results for a coarsely grained PFZ2-specimen. In its PFZ, which was created during the first aging treatment at 1079 K, and in between the large γ′-precipitates there are small (r 2 ≈ 4 nm) ones. Even very close to the carbide particles at the GB there are small γ′-precipitates. In the interior of the grains of the PFZ2-specimen the two γ′-precipitate dispersions are the same ones found in the NO-PFZ2-specimen throughout.', 'A micrograph of the dislocation configurations near a GB in a plastically deformed bimodal PFZ2-specimen is presented in Fig. 2 : there are pairs of dislocations even in the PFZ; they bow out because they are pinned by the 4nm-γ′-precipitates. But the bow outs are less strong than those found in the interior of the grains where the 26nm-γ′-precipitates act as pinning centers. The Orowan loops found around some of the 26nm-γ′-precipitates prove that the coarse (f1′,r1′) γ′-precipitate dispersion is close to being over-aged. The creation of such loops has been studied by Baither et al. by in-situ tensile tests performed inside a TEM.'], 'name': 'Transmission electron microscopy', 'type': 'ce_section'}], 'name': 'Experiments', 'type': 'ce_section'}]\n",

Solution treatment was carried at 793 K for 2 h. The SAED patterns in Fig. 1c–e reveal that the secondary phase in the as-cast Mg–Zn–Gd alloy is a Mg3Gd-type compound (D03, a = 0.720 nm). A chemical analysis by EDS showed the averaged compositions of Mg3Gd type compound are Mg–23 ± 2 at.% Gd–21 ± 3 at.% Zn. Mg3Gd-type compound particles are often observed in the α-Mg matrix and in grain boundaries. After solution heat treatment, the volume fraction of the Mg3Gd-type compound decreases.', 'Fig. 2 shows the isothermal annealing response of Vicker’s micro-hardness in the solution-treated Mg97Zn1Gd2 alloy. At an aging temperature of 473 K, the specimen exhibits remarkable age hardening. Its hardness reaches about 128Hv0.1. However, at aging temperatures >573 K, the hardness of the specimens remains <100Hv0.1 during long-term annealing.', 'TEM observations were carried out in order to elucidate the aging behavior of the alloy at various temperatures. β′-phase precipitation was observed after 60 h aging at 473 K. Figs. 3 a,b and c,d show TEM images and electron diffraction (ED) patterns of the peak-aged specimen (473 K for 150 h), taken with the incident beam parallel to [0 0 1]matrix and [1 1 0]matrix. The β′ precipitates elongate along the c-axis of the α-Mg matrix and extend along the [1 2 0]matrix-type directions of the α-Mg matrix. The ED patterns reveal that the β′-phase (Mg7Gd , orthorhombic, a = 0.64 nm, b = 2.25 nm, c = 0.52 nm) precipitates in the α-Mg matrix with the orientation relationship: [001]matrix//[100]β′,{100}matrix//(010)β′. This agrees with previous results where the peak aging hardness is thought to be due to the precipitation of β′-phases . In addition to the β-phase precipitation, β1-phase precipitation is also observed after 150 h annealing at 473 K. In the previous studies, it was reported that the β1-phase in Mg–Gd binary alloy has an fcc structure . Further research on the β1-phase crystalline structure in Zn-containing Mg–Gd alloy is now under way, and the results will be reported elsewhere. After annealing at 473 K for 250 h, plate-like precipitates of the β-phase (Mg5Gd , fcc, a = 2.27 nm) are observed in the over-aged specimen with the following orientation relationship: [1 1 0]matrix//[1 1 1]β and (0 0 1)matrix//(1 1 0)β. This orientation relationship is the same as that reported for the stable β-phase in Mg–Gd binary alloys .', 'Fig. 4 shows a TEM micrograph and SAED pattern of the Mg97Zn1Gd2 ternary alloy aged at 573 K for 10 h. The incident electron beam direction is parallel to the [1 1 0]matrix. A large number of stacking faults (SF) are observed in the Mg97Zn1Gd2 alloy. Strong streaks in the SAED pattern (b) also indicate the existence of SF. High-resolution TEM observation, as shown in Fig. 5 , demonstrates that SF is an intrinsic type, such as ABABA∣CBCBCB and ABABAB∣CACACA stacking sequences of a closely packed plane. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM observation (Fig. 6 ) reveals that solute elements such as Zn and Gd concentrate in two atom layers around SF. TEM images of the Mg98Gd2 binary alloys annealed at 573 K for 10 h are also shown in Fig. 7 for comparison. Only β-phase precipitation is observed in the Mg98Gd2 binary alloys aged at 573 K for 10 h. Addition of Zn to the Mg–Gd binary alloys inhibits precipitation of the β-phase during high-temperature aging.', 'The LPSO structure is observed in specimens aged at 673 K, as shown in Fig. 8 . The 13 extra spots divide the correlation length of (0 0 2)matrix in the SAED pattern. The spot of (00, 14)LPSO corresponds to that of (0 0 2)matrix. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 9 shows a stacking sequence of ABABABACBCBCBC (14H-type) with a period of 3.64 nm. This 14H-type structure is considered to be the same as the 14H-type structure observed in rapidly solidified and cast Mg97Zn1Y2 alloys. Fig. 10 shows low-magnification HAADF-STEM images of the Mg97Zn1Gd2 alloy annealed at 673 K for 10 h. It was found that solute elements concentrate in two atom layers periodically. For annealing at 673 K, there are two formation processes of the LPSO phase, that is, the precipitation from the supersaturated α-Mg matrix and the transformation from the Mg3Gd-type compound phase. Decomposition of the Mg3Gd-type compound phase to the 14H-LPSO phase is completed after annealing at 673 K for 30 h. At 773 K, the alloy consists of the α-Mg matrix and the 14H-LPSO phases, as shown in Fig. 11 . The morphology of the LPSO structure varies significantly with different annealing temperature and time, with increasing annealing temperature and time promoting growth of the LPSO phase along the c-axis of the α-Mg matrix, although the LPSO phase grows along the basal plane of the matrix at ∼673 K.', 'Fig. 12 shows the mechanical properties of the as-cast, solution-treated and annealed Mg97Zn1Gd2 alloys. At an aging temperature of 473 K, the tensile strength of the alloys increased with aging time. However, the specimen peak-aged for 150 h fractures in the elastic deformation region. High-temperature-aged specimens also exhibit high tensile strength, with their ultimate strength reaching 230 MPa at 573 K. Above 623 K, the yield strength decreased with increasing aging temperature, although the ultimate strength is a high stress level. The mechanical properties of an Mg98Gd2 alloy aged at 573 K for 10 h are shown as the open circles in Fig. 12 for comparison. The tensile and yield strength of the Mg97Zn1Gd2 alloys aged between 573 and 773 K with an SF or LPSO phase are higher than those of the β-phase Mg98Gd2 alloys.'], 'name': 'Experimental results', 'type': 'ce_section'}]\n",

To this end, in the cycle I, the effect of the solution time and temperature on the formability and the hardness after aging is studied at the three temperatures of 530\\xa0°C, 545\\xa0°C, and 560\\xa0°C and for the three holding time of 30\\xa0min, 75\\xa0min, and 120\\xa0min.

In the cycle I, the formed sheet in the supersaturated solid solution state is artificially aged at 180\\xa0°C for 6\\xa0h and naturally aged at room temperature for 14\\xa0days. Since the microstructure of the AA6061 sheet in the supersaturated state is highly unstable at the room temperature, the hardness test after the SPIF process and before the aging treatment is avoided to eliminate the effect of the preparation and hardness testing duration on results.']}, {'name': 'The heat treatment cycle I', 'content': ['As schematically shown in Fig. 2a, at the beginning of the cycle I, the solution treatment is carried out at the times and temperatures described in Section 2.3. According to Fig. 2a, the hardness is measured before the SPIF process. Figure 6 illustrates the hardness obtained after the solution treatment under different conditions. After 30\\xa0min of the solution treatment at all the investigated temperatures, the hardness significantly decreases due to homogenization and recovery. With the dissolution of the secondary phase in the matrix and by the annihilation of dislocations generated during the previous rolling process, the hardness of the sheet is considerably reduced from the initial value of 108.9 HV0.1. As explained in Section 3.5.3, by increasing the solution time, the size, volume, and type of precipitates available in matrix are altered and consequently the hardness is changed. The increasing trend of the hardness until the solution time of 75\\xa0min can be due to the recrystallization phenomenon. During the recrystallization phenomenon, new grains nucleate at old grain boundaries and the density of the grain boundaries increases. As a result, the hardness is improved compared to the solution time of 30\\xa0min, but is still significantly lower than the hardness of the as-received sheet. By increasing the solution time from 75\\xa0min to 120\\xa0min, different hardness behaviors can be observed at investigated solution temperatures. At the solution temperature of 560\\xa0°C, the volume of Mg2Si particles decreases and Si-rich precipitates grow. So, the hardness is reduced at this temperature for the solution time of 120\\xa0min. At the solution temperature of 545\\xa0°C, a constant trend is observed, but at the temperature of 530\\xa0°C, the increase in the hardness slightly continues due to the relatively low effect of the temperature. Therefore, it can be stated that by elevating the solution temperature, various phenomena such as homogenization, recrystallization, and grain growth as well as alterations in the volume, size, and type of precipitates can influence the hardness of the sheet after the solution treatment .', 'In order to assess the effect of the solution temperature and time on the formability in the cycle I, the truncated pyramid with the 70° wall angle was formed using SPIF after the solution treatment. Figure 7 indicates the maximum achievable forming depth at different times and temperatures of the solution treatment. As seen in Fig. 7, performing SPIF immediately after the solution treatment leads to the higher forming depth than SPIF on the as-received sheet. The highest formability is achieved by the solution treatment at 530\\xa0°C for 30\\xa0min, which shows an improvement of 81% in the formability compared to the as-received sheet. The lowest formability belongs to the solution temperature of 560\\xa0°C and time of 75\\xa0min, which still shows an increase of 50% in the forming depth compared to the as-received sheet. Regarding the inverse relationship between the formability and the hardness, the formability trend in Fig. 7 is in a good agreement with the hardness trend in Fig. 6.', 'All specimens formed under different conditions of the solution treatment in the cycle I were artificially aged at the temperature of 180\\xa0°C for 6\\xa0h and the hardness measurement was performed at the end of the heat treatment cycle, as demonstrated in Fig. 2a. For ease of comparison of the hardness at different conditions, the truncated pyramid with the 50° wall angle was chosen as the test geometry due to its proper forming depth at the investigated conditions. All specimens were formed up to the depth of 23\\xa0mm which is enough for a reliable hardness measurement. Figure 8 depicts the final hardness of the 50° pyramid at the end of the cycle I after the artificial aging treatment. As seen, the final hardness under the solution temperature of 560\\xa0°C and 530\\xa0°C is the highest and lowest, respectively, for all the holding times, which can be attributed to the hardness trend obtained after the solution treatment, as shown in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 8 for the solution temperature of 560\\xa0°C, the final hardness decreases as the holding time increases, which is contrary to the trend observed in Fig. 6 for the hardness immediately measured after the solution treatment. Hence, it can be stated that the effect of cold working and artificial aging as well as the influence of homogenization, recrystallization, and grain growth on the final hardness can be controlled by different conditions of the solution treatment.', 'It can be concluded from Fig. 8 that a wide range of the final hardness from lower to 10.5% higher than that of the as-received sheet can be obtained by utilizing the heat treatment cycle I, while according to Fig. 7, the forming depth is higher than that of the as-received sheet under all the investigated conditions. Regarding Figs. 7 and 8, it is possible to choose an appropriate solution time and temperature for the heat treatment cycles II and III. The solution treatment at the temperature of 560\\xa0°C results in lower forming depths and higher hardness values. Since in the present study the formability is of great importance and also local melting can occur in grain boundaries at high temperatures, the solution temperature of 560\\xa0°C cannot be considered as an appropriate temperature. The forming depths obtained under the two temperatures of 530\\xa0°C and 545\\xa0°C are approximately close to each other and accordingly the final hardness is taken into account to choose the proper value for the solution temperature. Therefore, the appropriate solution temperature and time are selected as 545\\xa0°C and 75\\xa0min for the following heat treatment cycles. So, hereafter, the solution treatment means the one at 545\\xa0°C for 75\\xa0min.', 'Figures 9 and 10 compare the formability and final hardness of the 50° and 70° pyramids in the heat treatment cycle I under the appropriate solution condition obtained above and the as-received condition, respectively. Figure 10 shows the final hardness after both the artificial and natural (14\\xa0days) aging. As it is obvious from Figs. 9 and 10, the 70° pyramid has the higher hardness and the smaller forming depth than the 50° pyramid at each considered condition. By increasing the wall angle, a higher tension and deformation are imposed in the sheet, and as a result of the strain hardening, the final hardness increases, and due to the more thinning, the forming depth decreases. As seen in Fig. 9, the forming depth of the 70° pyramid is improved from 7\\xa0mm in the as-received condition to 11.3\\xa0mm in the cycle I, which shows an enhancement of 61%. Regarding Fig. 10 for the 70° pyramid, the microhardness after cold working on the initial sheet is 124 HV0.1, while the microhardness in the cycle I under the artificial aging is 115.2 HV0.1, which shows a decrease of 7%. Also, the natural aging results in a decrease of 23% in the final hardness of the 70° pyramid, as compared to the formed specimen under the as-received condition. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the trend of the final hardness under different conditions is the same for the 50° and 70° pyramids.']}, {'name': 'The heat treatment cycle II', 'content': ['According to Fig. 2b, in the heat treatment cycle II, the initial sheet is solution treated at the appropriate condition of Section 3.2 followed by the artificial and natural aging at the certain time and temperature of Section 2.3. Then, SPIF of the truncated pyramid with the 50° and 70° wall angles is carried out. Figure 11 compares the hardness values of the truncated pyramids formed under the two aging conditions and the as-received state. The final hardness of the specimen formed from the artificially aged sheet is the highest. The difference between the hardness values obtained by the artificial aging in the cycle II and the as-received T6 state can be attributed to the different time and temperature of the heat treatment employed in the present research. The hardness of the undeformed sheet before the SPIF process was obtained as 81.8 HV0.1 and 112 HV0.1 under the natural and artificial aging, respectively. It is worth noting that the hardness of the as-received sheet is 108.9 HV0.1. The lower hardness of the naturally aged sheet can be related to the aging time of 14\\xa0days which may be not enough to reach the peak aging.', 'Regarding Fig. 6, the hardness of the solution treated sheet at the obtained appropriate condition is equal to 67.7 HV0.1 which is then raised to 115.2 HV0.1 for the 70° wall angle at the end of the cycle I showing an improvement of 70% in the hardness, as depicted in Fig. 10. But, in the cycle II by performing SPIF of the 70° wall angle pyramid after artificial aging, the final hardness is enhanced by 95% compared to the solution treated sheet, as shown in Fig. 11. The same trend can be observed for the 70° wall angle under the natural aging state and for the 50° wall angle. It can be pointed out that after the solution treatment and the homogenization of the alloy, due to the reduction of the amount of precipitates, the forming process before the aging treatment in the cycle I cannot increase dislocations and the hardness as much as possible in the cycle II. This issue can be attributed to the dislocation accumulation near precipitates in the matrix.', 'The maximum achievable forming depth in the cycle II and the as-received state is compared in Fig. 12. Generally, the trend of the forming depth is consistent with the inverse trend of the hardness measured before the aging treatment. As seen, the artificially aged sheet in the cycle II has the lowest forming depth for the both wall angles. For the wall angle of 50°, the reduction in the forming depth of the artificially aged sheet in the cycle II is 75% compared to the as-received sheet. By sacrificing the formability, only 12% improvement in the final hardness is attained. For the wall angle of 70°, the forming depth reduction by artificial aging is 17.5%, while the hardness increase is 6% as compared to the as-received sheet. It is obvious from Fig. 12 that the natural aging of the cycle II results in a 24% improvement in the formability of the 70° wall angle as compared to the as-received sheet, which is accompanied with a 13% decrease in the final hardness.', 'By comparing Figs. 9 and 12 for the 70° wall angle, it can be stated that the formability under the artificial aging in the cycle I is higher than the one under the as-received state, while in the cycle II, the formability is reduced by performing SPIF after the artificial aging. In other words, by doing SPIF after the solution treatment and before the artificial aging, the formability of the 70° pyramid is enhanced by 98% as compared to the cycle in which SPIF is performed after the artificial aging. But, this formability improvement in the cycle I is accompanied with a decrease of 13% in the final hardness, as compared to the cycle II.']}, {'name': 'The heat treatment cycle III', 'content': ['Based on Fig. 2c for the heat treatment cycle III, at first, the annealing treatment is carried out on the initial sheet, which leads to a significant hardness reduction from 108.9 HV0.1 to 38 HV0.1. As seen in Fig. 13, this hardness reduction before the deformation process leads to an improvement in the formability by an amount of 100% for the 70° pyramid, as compared to the as-received sheet. The obtained enhancement in the forming depth of the 70° pyramid using the cycle III is higher than those attained by the two other heat treatment cycles. This is due to the fact that the microstructure of the sheet before SPIF in the cycle I is affected by the recrystallization and alterations of the type and amount of precipitates and during the cycle II is influenced by the aging treatment. Both the cycles I and II result in a higher hardness than the annealing treatment for the sheet before the forming process. The most important point to consider here is that the final hardness of the part in the cycle III can reach the value obtainable by the two other cycles, as depicted in Fig. 14. Figure 14 shows the hardness value at different stages of Fig. 2c for the heat treatment cycle III.', 'Regarding Fig. 14, by cold working, the hardness of the annealed sheet increases, but this improvement cannot compensate the hardness drop occurring during the annealing treatment . The increase of the hardness of the annealed sheet resulting from cold working is 43% and 71% for the 50° and 70° pyramid, respectively. Hence, in the cycle III, it is necessary to perform the aging treatment on the formed pyramids to further increase their hardness values. As seen in Fig. 14, the natural aging cannot increase the final hardness up to the one obtained in the SPIF of the as-received sheet. While using the artificial aging, the final hardness values of the 50° and 70° pyramids are respectively 3% lower and 2% higher than those obtained from the as-received sheet. As a result, the final hardness of the pyramid formed under the artificial aging of the cycle III is comparable to that of the as-received sheet after cold working for the both wall angles. It is worth noting that the final hardness of the artificially aged pyramid is improved by 82% and 95% for the 50° and 70° wall angles, respectively, as compared to the annealed sheet after cold working.']}]\n",
